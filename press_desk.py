"""Press Desk — the artist's own media list, announcements and pitches.

Everything here belongs to one artist and is reached only from their
session. The public half is a single route, /press/<token>, which is the
page a journalist opens: one announcement, its assets, and nothing that
requires an account.

On sending, which is the part worth being careful about:

  A press pitch is not a fan blast. It goes to a small chosen list, one
  message at a time, and the reply has to land somewhere the artist
  actually reads. So the desk prepares personalised messages first and
  treats sending as a separate, explicit act with two routes:

    From your own inbox   Always available. The desk writes each message
                          and hands it over. The journalist sees a real
                          person's address and replies to it.

    From Street Banker    Only when a provider is connected AND a real
                          sending domain is set. It is refused - not
                          quietly degraded - while EMAIL_FROM is unset,
                          because the shared test sender delivers only to
                          the account owner's own inbox. Every send would
                          report success and no journalist would ever get
                          one. A press desk that lies about delivery is
                          worse than one that cannot send.

  Recipients marked do-not-contact or bounced are dropped in the store
  while the pitch is built, so no form can reach them.

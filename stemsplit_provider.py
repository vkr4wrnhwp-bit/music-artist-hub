"""StemSplit.io — the Stem Deck's studio-quality separation tier.

Env-gated on STEMSPLIT_API_KEY (pasted into Render Environment, never
through chat). Without the key the feature does not render and its
endpoints answer 503 - nothing pretends.

Flow, shaped around the Render Starter's limits:
  1. The Rack uploads the loaded track once; we park it on disk under an
     unguessable token and lend StemSplit a public URL to fetch it from
     (their documented source_url flow) - the dyno never re-streams the
     source to the API.
  2. We create a FOUR_STEMS job and the browser polls our status proxy;
     the key stays server-side.
  3. Finished stems stream back through us (their presigned URLs make no
     CORS promises), then the temp source is deleted. A sweeper also
     drops anything older than an hour so restarts cannot leak files.

Uses urllib - no new dependency.

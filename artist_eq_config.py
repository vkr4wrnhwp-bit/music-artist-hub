"""The Artist EQ: six strategic channels, and the plan they produce.

This replaces the fifteen-band frequency equaliser. The bands were
engraved 25 Hz through 16 kHz, which was a joke the interface could not
land: these are business priorities, and dressing them as audio
frequencies made a serious diagnostic read as a novelty plug-in.

Everything here is configuration plus deterministic functions over it.
Nothing is random and nothing is a prediction - the same six numbers
always produce the same plan, which matters because the browser computes
it live while /plan recomputes it server-side from a link, and the two
have to agree.

What the score is: a weighted average of six self-reported priorities,
scaled to 100, with a small preset weighting. What it is not: a
forecast. It cannot say whether a record will land, whether a label will
call, or whether money will come back - and nothing here claims it can.

# Capability status

One source of truth: `capability_status.py`. Every public surface reads
from it — homepage, product tour, product pages, partner page and the
privacy language. Before this, the same capability could read Live on
one page and Integration ready on another and nothing failed.

Six statuses and no others. Colour is never the only signal: every chip
carries its own word, so the meaning survives greyscale and
colour-blindness.

| Status | Means |
| --- | --- |
| **Live** | Working in the product today. |
| **Example** | A worked example, not an artist's data. |
| **Partner delivered** | Carried out through a named partner. |
| **Integration ready** | Built here; the outside connection is not live. |
| **Coming soon** | Not built yet. |
| **Requires verification** | A finding a person must check before it is acted on. |

## Resolved against the deployment

Some capabilities are only live when credentials are actually present.
A hardcoded "Live" on a marketing page silently becomes false the
moment a key is missing, so these carry a probe instead of a fixed
status and the page states what is true of the running deployment.

| Capability | Probe | If present | If absent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spotify pre-save | `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` + `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | Live | Integration ready |
| Release-day email | `RESEND_API_KEY` | Live | Integration ready |
| Subscriptions and billing | `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Live | Coming soon |

**On this deployment right now** (as generated):

- **Spotify pre-save** — Integration ready. The flow is built and not connected on this deployment. Pre-save buttons collect a notify-me instead, and no Spotify token is requested, stored or processed.
- **Release-day email** — Integration ready. Built, and no email provider is connected on this deployment.
- **Subscriptions and billing** — Coming soon. No payment provider is connected on this deployment.

### Why this matters for Spotify pre-save

The OAuth flow, token storage and release-day save are all implemented,
and all of them are gated on credentials. With those unset the feature
falls back to notify-me and no token is ever requested. The privacy
page's statement about encrypting pre-save tokens is therefore
conditional on the same probe: with credentials absent it says instead
that no Spotify token is requested, stored or processed.

## Rules for adding a capability

1. If it is not built, it is **Coming soon**. There is no label meaning "nearly".
2. If the interface exists and the outside connection does not, it is
   **Integration ready** — never Live.
3. If somebody else performs it, it is **Partner delivered**, and the partner is named.
4. If the data on screen is invented, the label is **Example** and the
   surrounding copy says so in words as well as in a chip.
5. If it depends on a credential, give it a **probe**, not a fixed status.
6. No figure appears on any public surface that was not computed from a
   real input. No recovery totals, stream counts, artist counts, country
   counts, earnings or accuracy percentages.

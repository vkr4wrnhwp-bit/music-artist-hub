"""What past rollouts actually converted, so the next one can start there.

Rollout Studio measures this properly already. Every post gets its own
Street Banker Links variant, named `rollout_{platform}_{phase}_{date}`
and carrying `utm_source={platform}`, so every click and every fan signup
is attributable to a platform and a release phase.

Then `rollout_engine.next_action` finishes with:

    "Rollout is live — watch the performance page for what converts."

...and the generator that plans the next one takes no performance
argument at all. The app told the artist to watch what converts and then
did not watch it itself. The next rollout's platform list came from
whichever checkboxes happened to be ticked.

The good news is that nothing needs migrating. `clear_posts` deletes
`ro_posts` on regenerate, but it never touches `ml_variants`, so the
variant names and their events survive every regeneration - the whole
history is already on disk, going back to the first rollout ever run.

Two rules this module keeps:

  It refuses to speak on thin evidence. A platform with four clicks
  is not a finding, it is noise, and saying otherwise would teach an
  artist to trust a number that cannot bear it.

  It reports rates, not totals. The platform that got the most clicks is
  usually just the platform that got the most posts.

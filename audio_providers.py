"""Street Banker Audio Intelligence - the provider seam.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
Audio vendors supply transcription, speech, agents, dubbing and generative
audio. Street Banker supplies the music-industry judgement around them:
rights, consent, relationships, approval, billing, and the record of who
decided what. The vendor is infrastructure and must stay replaceable, so
nothing in the domain is named after one.

Every capability is an abstract base class here. Adapters live in
audio_mock.py (complete, credential-free) and audio_elevenlabs.py (real,
env-gated). The registry picks one per capability from configuration, so
swapping a vendor is a settings change, not a refactor.

WHAT A PROVIDER MAY NOT DECIDE
------------------------------
A provider never decides whether a job is allowed. Entitlement, consent,
rights, retention and budget are settled before an adapter is called, by
audio_policy.gate(). An adapter that is handed work can assume the work
was authorised; it may still refuse on its own terms (unsupported
feature, unverified retention, bad input) and that refusal is honest.

HEALTH IS A FACT, NOT A GUESS
-----------------------------
health() reports what the adapter can actually verify right now. A mock
says it is a mock. A real adapter with no credentials says unconfigured -
it never reports healthy on the strength of a key it has not used.

"""Street Banker plan tiers and product worlds.

Four purchasable sections: Promote (Artist tier), Royalty Sweep (Pro
tier), Label Services, and the free Fan side. The old demo padlocks
become the paywall: pages above your tier render an upgrade card.
Payments are simulated until Stripe lands — plan switches are labeled
as demo everywhere.

"""Config-driven data for the Dispute / Audit center.

Formal disputes raised against payers (distributors, PROs, labels) when
royalties look wrong — underpayment, unmatched usage, misattribution, or
a full audit. Each dispute moves through a resolution pipeline; the
advance action steps it to the next stage. Disputes live in a
module-level store so status changes persist for the session.

Amounts in dispute are illustrative demo data referencing real song
titles where applicable.

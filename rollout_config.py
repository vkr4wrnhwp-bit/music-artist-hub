"""Section 8 — Rollout Engine.

A release turned into a campaign: dates, content, routing, follow-through.
The photograph is a venue wall with calendars on it; the words are markup.

The sample campaign is labelled an example everywhere it appears, and the
statuses are the ones the app actually uses. Where Street Banker cannot
publish for you - which is everywhere - the copy says schedule-ready
rather than scheduled.

"""Section 10 — Global Distribution.

Every claim here was checked against the app and against the business
terms already published on /services/distribution before it was written.

What is true: releases are prepared and validated inside Street Banker -
the Metadata Passport, the Clean Release checklist and the Release
Scheduler are real and in the app - and delivery goes out through
SummitArts on Symphonic Distribution, which is the partnership the
services page already states. The partner's own published terms are the
source for the platform count and the set-up fees, and they are
attributed rather than claimed as Street Banker's.

What the reference image claimed and this does not: 200+ countries (the
partner says platforms, not countries), every major platform, keep 100%,
real-time reports, no hidden fees, free to get started, no credit card
required, cancel anytime. None of those is supported by anything in this
codebase or in the terms on file, so none of them is on the page.

"""Section 9 — Royalty Sweep.

Catalog investigation, not banking. The section is a header, one archive
photograph, five stages and a way in; the picture carries the feeling and
the words carry the meaning.

The language here is deliberate. Nothing is recovered, found or
guaranteed - things are possible, suspected, potential, and every one of
them requires verification. Where a figure could ever appear it is
labelled an estimated value range and said to need checking.

"""Section 4 — one system, six departments.

Six parts of one career, laid across one photograph rather than six.
The picture is a single documentary frame; the slices, the dividers, the
tonal steps and every word are markup, so the photograph is never cut up
into six files that could drift apart.

Destinations: only eleven routes on this site answer a signed-out
visitor, and none of them is a per-department explainer. So a department
points at a public route where one exists (the free sweep) and at the
homepage surface that already covers it otherwise. Nothing here points at
a login wall - a stranger asking what a department does must never be
handed a password field.

# Tone per slice, left to right. These are washes at very low alpha laid
# over the photograph, not filters: the brief for this section asks for a
# progression a reader feels rather than sees, and anything heavier turns
# a documentary frame into six coloured panels.

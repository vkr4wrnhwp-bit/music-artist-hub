"""One source of truth for what is real.

Every public surface — homepage, product tour, product pages, partner
page, privacy language — reads its status from here. Before this, the
same capability could read Live on one page and Integration ready on
another, and nothing failed when they disagreed.

Six statuses and no others:

    LIVE                  working in the product today
    EXAMPLE               a worked example, nobody's real data
    PARTNER_DELIVERED     performed by a named partner, not by us
    INTEGRATION_READY     built here; the outside connection is not live
    COMING_SOON           not built yet
    REQUIRES_VERIFICATION a finding a person must check before it is acted on

The important part is `resolve()`. Some capabilities are only live when
credentials are actually present in the environment, and a hardcoded
"Live" on a marketing page is a claim that silently becomes false the
moment a key is missing. Those entries carry a `probe` instead of a fixed
status, so the page says what is true of the running deployment rather
than what was true when somebody wrote the copy.

Spotify pre-save is the case that forced this: the OAuth flow, token
storage and release-day save are all implemented, but every one of them
is gated on SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET. With those unset
the feature falls back to notify-me, and any page claiming Live is wrong.

# The stylesheet is committed so that deploying REACH stays a pure-Python
# operation — pip install, gunicorn, done. Node is needed only to regenerate it,
# and only when a template gains a utility class that is not already in the
# build. Tailwind v3 is pinned deliberately: it is what cdn.tailwindcss.com
# served while these screens were designed, so a rebuild changes nothing.

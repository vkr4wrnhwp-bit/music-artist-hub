# REACH — Test Plan

```bash
cd reach-app
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest -q
```

**179 tests pass**, all of them REACH's own. REACH is a standalone application
with its own suite; the sibling products in this repository run their own tests
in their own CI jobs and share nothing with these.

| File | Tests | Covers |
| --- | --: | --- |
| `tests/test_security.py` | 40 | Prompt injection, SSRF, DNS rebinding, redirects, downloads, robots, CAPTCHA/login walls, the AI firewall |
| `tests/test_compliance.py` | 35 | Campaign modes, approval integrity, contact categories, suppression, bounces, opt-out, deduplication, paid and guaranteed offers, tenant isolation, kill switches, audit |
| `tests/test_pipeline.py` | 48 | Campaign creation, profile provenance, query planning, discovery, scoring, staleness, quota, provider honesty, durable jobs, placements, metrics, sender health |
| `tests/test_web.py` | 28 | Every screen renders; REACH mounts no other product's routes; honest labelling holds in the rendered HTML; API endpoints |
| `tests/test_dns.py` | 15 | SPF/DKIM/DMARC/MX lookups; ABSENT vs UNRESOLVED; caching; contact-domain validation |
| `tests/test_catalog.py` | 13 | REACH's own catalog: the standalone import guard, add/delete, UNKNOWN preservation, sample labelling, readiness |

## Test isolation

`tests/conftest.py` gives every test:

* an isolated SQLite database in a per-test `tmp_path`, migrated fresh;
* **all `REACH_*` environment variables cleared**, so no ambient credential can
  make a test pass that would fail in a clean environment;
* `fetcher.FixtureTransport` — the deterministic web corpus, no network;
* `dns_checks.offline_resolver()` — an injected resolver that answers ABSENT for
  everything, so a test expecting a passing sender must publish its own records;
* `email_provider.RecordingTransport` — messages are captured, never sent;
* a cleared robots cache, rate state and provider token caches;
* a freshly seeded tenant, principal, policy registry and catalog mirror.

No test touches the network. `clock.freeze` makes time-dependent behaviour
(backoff, staleness, cooldowns) deterministic.

## Red-team fixtures

`reach/fixtures/web.py` is a corpus of reserved `.example` domains — nothing in
it can resolve to a real site. It deliberately mixes legitimate outlets with the
adversarial cases REACH must survive:

| Fixture | Attack or edge case |
| --- | --- |
| `trapdoor.example` | Prompt injection in a `display:none` div and an HTML comment; role reassignment; secret exfiltration; concealment; a honeypot address in `aria-hidden` markup |
| `streamboost.example` | Guaranteed streams, artificial-streaming language, unrealistic claims |
| `playlistgold.example` | Guaranteed placement plus a submission fee |
| `curatorfee.example` | Legitimate paid consideration that must be priced and disclosed, not blocked |
| `memberspool.example` | Login wall |
| `formwall.example` | CAPTCHA-protected form |
| `norobots.example` | `Disallow: /private` alongside an allowed path |
| `dormantwaves.example` | Stale outlet, submissions explicitly closed |
| `brokenmarkup.example` | Malformed HTML with an unclosed `<title>` and an unquoted, unclosed `<a>` |
| `bigfile.example` | 2.1 MB response, `.exe` download, disallowed PDF MIME type |
| `redirector.example` | Redirect to a cloud metadata endpoint; redirect loop |
| `personalblog.example` | Personal free-mail address that must never become a route |
| `darkcircuit.example` | One curator, five playlists, one submissions inbox — the consolidation case |
| `dunkelklang.example` | German-language outlet for local-language query families |

## Deliberate testing choices

**Adversarial cases are fed deterministically.** The consolidation and injection
tests enqueue their fixture URLs directly rather than hoping a search ranks them.
The behaviour under test is the pipeline's response, not the search ranking.

**Negative assertions are as load-bearing as positive ones.** Several tests
assert `mail.sent == []` after an operation that must not send. A test that only
checks the happy path would pass against a system that sends when it should not.

**UNKNOWN is asserted explicitly.**
`test_unknown_components_are_reported_as_unknown_not_zero` fails if score
components silently coerce unknown values to zero — the failure mode that turns
an honest dashboard into a misleading one.

## On scenario 39

**Lint:** `ruff check .` runs in CI, configured in `pyproject.toml`. The rule set
is deliberately narrow — pycodestyle errors plus pyflakes (`E4`, `E7`, `E9`,
`F`). Those catch genuine defects (undefined names, unused imports, shadowed
variables) without imposing a formatter on files that predate the config. Line
length is **not** enforced: the existing code runs to ~120 characters and
reformatting it was not this change's job.

Adding the gate surfaced 11 real findings, all in REACH's own code — ten dead
imports and one dead local (`route` in `drafts.py`, left behind when cost moved
to approval time). All are fixed.

**Type checking:** no type checker is configured. The codebase uses no
annotations anywhere, so `mypy` would either report nothing useful or demand a
project-wide annotation pass — a change worth making deliberately, not as a
side effect of this feature.

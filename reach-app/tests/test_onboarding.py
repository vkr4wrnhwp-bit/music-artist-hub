"""First-run guidance.

The panel exists because REACH runs with no configuration at all — a deliberate
property that leaves a first-time operator unable to tell which parts are inert.
Every item is answered from the database or the environment, so these tests
assert the answers change with the state rather than that a checklist renders.

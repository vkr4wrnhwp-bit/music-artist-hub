"""Audio Studio - the artist-facing surface for phases 4, 5 and 6.

WHAT IS HERE
------------
  Global Release Pack      dubbing a release into other languages
  Campaign Audio Toolkit   voiceover and sound effects for a campaign
  Remix Lab Audio Engine   stem separation and voice isolation
  Artist Voice Vault       registering a voice the OWNER verified

One page rather than four, because they are the same act with different
verbs - upload something you own, confirm you own it, run one operation -
and four pages would each grow their own half of the rights check.

EVERY LANE IS OFF UNTIL ITS OWN FLAG IS SET
-------------------------------------------
The page renders with nothing enabled and says so per lane. An artist should
be able to see what the product would do before an operator switches on
anything that costs money.

THE VOICE VAULT IS DIFFERENT AND SAYS SO
----------------------------------------
Every other lane processes a recording. The Vault registers a VOICE, which is
a person. Street Banker never holds the voice model - it records a reference
to one the owner verified through the vendor's own process, plus the
permission record around it. A manager cannot register an artist's voice from
this page, and the mock adapter refuses it too, so the calling code meets that
path in development rather than in production.

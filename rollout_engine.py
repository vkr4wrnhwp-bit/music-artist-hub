"""Rollout Studio generation engine.

Turns a release (title, artist, date, lyrics, assets, goal, tone) into a
dated social rollout: phased posting schedule, platform-specific captions
and hashtags, video edit plans (edit decision lists — the system never
pretends it rendered a video), and one Street Banker Links variant per
post so attribution flows back through ml_events.

Deterministic template generation for now; the AI provider slots in behind
generate_rollout() later without changing callers.

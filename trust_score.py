"""Street Banker Trust Score.

One partner-facing number that says: this artist's business is in order.
Ten factors, ten points each, every point computed from real account
state — metadata coverage, documented splits, connected statements,
consented fan data, release readiness, sync clearance, press kit,
deal hygiene, tracked promo, and catalog depth. Factors under 5 are
blockers, and every blocker names its fix.

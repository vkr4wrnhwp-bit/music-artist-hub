"""Section 12 — the closing statement, and the trust band above it.

The last frame: an empty room, one road case, the catalog on the floor.
The photograph carries the argument; the copy says the two sentences and
stops. No feature list, no figures, no recap.

The trust band that sits above it is four columns of text - what the
artist keeps, what happens to their data, what the Twin will and will not
claim, and what a royalty finding is worth before somebody checks it.
Every one of those is a promise made elsewhere on this homepage, gathered
in one place where it can be read at a glance.

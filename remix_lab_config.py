"""Remix Lab — one release into more moments, rights-safe.

A professional music-business tool, not a novelty AI toy: remix briefs,
social edit concepts, DJ edit directions and producer-ready concepts for
artists who own or control their audio.

Two rules govern everything here:

  1. Rights first. Uploads require an ownership confirmation and a
     no-likeness confirmation before the button so much as enables, and
     reference text is screened for imitation requests - no "sound
     like", no voice cloning, no protected-style copying. The screen
     runs in the browser AND must run again server-side when generation
     is wired up; the pattern list below is the single source for both.

  2. No faking. Whether generation is connected is now a FACT about the
     deployment, read from engine_live(), and every claim on the page is
     conditional on it: the hero chip, the note by the form, the note on
     the example panel, and capability_status. When it is off the page
     says so and the results panel is a worked example labelled EXAMPLE
     OUTPUT; when it is on the page says what is actually measured. The
     "worth making" read stays bands describing fit and effort in both
     states - it predicts no streams, no placement and no revenue.

No real artist, producer or celebrity is named anywhere in this file,
including in the examples of what not to do.

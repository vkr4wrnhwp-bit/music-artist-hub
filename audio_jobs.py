"""Street Banker Audio Intelligence - the job runner.

THE ONE WAY IN
--------------
Every piece of audio work goes through submit(). It gates, records, dispatches
and settles, in that order, and there is no second entry point. A caller that
reaches an adapter directly has bypassed consent, entitlement, retention and
the usage ledger, so the adapters are never imported anywhere but here and the
gate.

SYNCHRONOUS AND SLOW WORK, ONE SHAPE
------------------------------------
Speech and sound effects come back in one call. Dubbing and stem separation
take minutes and answer later, by polling or by webhook. Both produce the same
audio_jobs row and the same statuses, so the UI has one thing to render and one
thing to poll. A fast job simply reaches "completed" inside submit().

REFUSAL IS NOT FAILURE
----------------------
ProviderRefusal -> "rejected", terminal, never retried: the provider has made a
decision and trying again will produce the same decision while costing another
call. ProviderUnavailable -> back to "queued" until MAX_ATTEMPTS: the vendor was
unreachable, which is a condition that passes. Collapsing the two is how a repo
ends up hammering an endpoint that has said no.

BILLING IS RECORDED ON THE WAY OUT, ALWAYS
------------------------------------------
record_usage runs for mock jobs too, with a null cost. A ledger that only has
rows when a vendor was involved cannot answer "what did this artist actually
use", which is the question the ledger exists for.

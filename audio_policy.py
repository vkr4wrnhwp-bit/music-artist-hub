"""Street Banker Audio Intelligence - the gate.

Nothing reaches a provider without passing through gate(). It is one
function on purpose: ten separate checks scattered across ten call sites is
how a repo ends up with nine of them applied.

THE TEN CHECKS, IN THIS ORDER
-----------------------------
 1. global feature flag        - is this capability on at all
 2. tenant entitlement         - does this partner's plan include it
 3. tenant toggle              - has this partner switched it off
 4. provider entitlement       - is an adapter registered and healthy
 5. user permission            - does this seat hold the capability
 6. usage limit                - is there budget left
 7. consent                    - recording/disclosure consent on file
 8. rights confirmation        - ownership asserted where audio is processed
 9. retention configuration    - can the policy actually be honoured
10. provider health            - is the adapter able to work right now

Order matters. The cheap, certain refusals come first so an unentitled
request never costs a database round trip to the usage ledger, and the
provider is asked last because it is the only check that can be slow.

WHY IT RETURNS A DECISION RATHER THAN RAISING
---------------------------------------------
A refusal is something a person reads. Each one carries a code the UI can
branch on and a sentence that says what would make it pass, because "403"
tells an artist nothing about the consent box they did not tick.

THE ZERO-RETENTION RULE
-----------------------
If a partner requires zero retention and the adapter cannot prove it
supports it for this account, the answer is no. Not a downgrade, not a
warning, not a job that runs anyway with a flag set. Telling somebody
their audio was never stored when it was is the one mistake here with no
remedy.

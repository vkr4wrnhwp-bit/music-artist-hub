"""Config-driven data for the Advance / Funding marketplace.

Turns the advance eligibility already computed on the Valuation page into
concrete, comparable funding offers plus a request flow. Offer amounts
are derived from the real suggested-advance figure so they stay
consistent with Valuation; terms/providers are illustrative.

This is a simulated demo only: requesting an offer records interest and
returns a reference number. No real money moves, no application is
submitted, and no financial credentials are ever collected.

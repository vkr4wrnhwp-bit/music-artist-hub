# Build audit

**First production-capable release. Audited 2026-08-17.**

Status vocabulary, used strictly:

| | |
|---|---|
| **REAL** | implemented, tested, and verified running |
| **DEV-LABELED** | functional and spec-correct, but not validated against the live third party |
| **PARTIAL** | legitimately started, incomplete, and described as such |
| **NOT BUILT** | absent, and never represented as working |

---

## The one thing to read first

**No live provider API call has ever been made from this build.** Every vendor
host — MuAPI, Google, fal, Runway, Luma, Replicate — was blocked by the
development environment's egress policy (403 at the CONNECT tunnel, an
organization policy denial). The adapters were therefore written against each
vendor's **own client library or machine-readable spec**, not from memory, and
are correct as far as those sources go. They have not touched the wire.

**Total live spend: $0.00.** Not "under the cap" — zero, because no billable call
was reachable. The `$2` cap was never approached.

Everything else below is genuinely exercised: the pipeline runs end to end
against the mock provider, which renders real MP4s with ffmpeg.

### Claude agent layer

| Feature | Status | Files | Verification |

| 7 producer agents with permissions | **REAL (definitions)** | `packages/agents/src/agents.ts` | system prompts, permission model, and forced-JSON schemas are defined and wired |
| Agent-run persistence + ledger integration | **REAL** | `agent_runs` table, `entryType: 'agent'` | schema present; QC path writes to the ledger |
| Agents driving the pipeline end to end | **PARTIAL** | — | the QC vision path is wired into the worker. The Creative Director, Shot Designer, Continuity Supervisor, and Cost Controller are defined with schemas and permissions but are **not yet invoked from an API route or the UI** |
| Claude Agent SDK (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`) subprocess orchestration | **NOT BUILT** | — | the Messages API was used directly instead: the worker needs a small, pinned bundle and per-call cost attribution into the same ledger as video spend, which the subprocess model does not give |

### Not built

| Feature | Why |
|---|---|
| Gemini Omni Flash adapter | A different API entirely (Interactions, stateful, token-metered). Needs its own adapter, not a flag. See `docs/model-capabilities.md` |
| Cloud-GPU benchmark harness | The self-hosted adapter refuses to quote without measured numbers, which is the honest posture; the harness that *produces* those numbers is not written |
| Scene-level and org-level budget **UI** | Both scopes are enforced in the cost engine; only the project scope has an editor |
| OpenTelemetry export | Logs carry trace-shaped fields (`trace_id`, `job_id`, `provider`) but there is no OTLP exporter |
| API rate limiting | Documented as a gap; deploy behind a rate-limiting proxy |
| Per-org encrypted provider credentials | `provider_credentials` table and `SECRETS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` exist; this release reads keys from the environment only |

---

## Testing added after the hardening pass

**The S3 driver now makes real HTTP requests.** It previously had no test that
opened a socket: the SigV4 signer was verified against AWS's published vector,
but URL construction, key encoding, list-XML parsing, status mapping and
presigned-URL fetchability were all unexercised. A minimal S3-compatible server
lives in `packages/asset-storage/test/s3-server.ts` and 12 tests drive the real
driver against it.

Two of its checks are genuinely independent rather than circular:

- It hashes the bytes that actually arrived and compares them to the driver's
  declared `x-amz-content-sha256`, so a body signed differently from the body
  sent is a 400.
- It re-derives each path segment's percent-encoding from the S3 spec's rule
  (only `A-Za-z0-9-._~` literal) and compares it to the raw path on the wire.
  Node's `URL` leaves characters like `(` alone, so this is the only way to
  catch a driver that skipped its own encoder — and it is the encoding the
  signature is computed over, so a mismatch would be a 403 at AWS.

The suite was mutation-checked rather than trusted for passing: breaking the
payload hash failed 10 tests, breaking presign date stability failed 1, and
breaking key encoding initially failed **none** — which exposed a real gap in
the test, fixed by adding the spec-derived encoding check above.

It is not a compatibility oracle. Passing proves the driver speaks well-formed
S3 to something expecting S3, not that AWS agrees, so risk #12 is downgraded
rather than closed.

## Resilience defects found by the same review

The verifier refuted these as *security* findings, correctly — they are
usability and performance defects. They were sitting in the screens an operator
uses all day, so they are fixed anyway:

| Defect | Why it mattered |
|---|---|
| `AsyncBlock` returned the error callout *instead of* data whenever an error was set | one failed poll blanked the whole queue table, the stat cards and the cost-controller callout, replacing a working screen with a line of red text. Stale data with a banner beats losing what you were reading; the error now only takes the screen when there is nothing else to show |
| The queue polled every 4s forever, with no backoff and no pause when hidden | a tab left open polled all night for nobody, and retrying into a 429 at full speed spent the budget that would let it recover. Now backs off exponentially on consecutive failures, stops while the document is hidden, and refreshes on return |
| Free pricing previews shared the paid `render` budget | a producer iterating in the cost lab spent the allowance the submission needed, so the refusal landed on the submit rather than the preview |

Both UI fixes are pinned by a browser test that fails against the old code —
verified by reverting the change and watching it fail.

## Bugs an adversarial review of the hardening work found and fixed

Four agents attacked the new rate-limit and CSRF code from independent angles;
each candidate finding was then handed to a separate agent told to refute it.
Nine survived and are fixed, with a regression test each:

| Defect | Why it mattered |
|---|---|
| `classify()` read the raw URL while the router matches the decoded one | `POST /api/shots/x/%72ender` reached the render handler but was billed to the cheaper `mutation` budget |
| The per-account login budget was keyed on email alone and charged before authentication | anyone who knew your address could hold you out of your own account for five requests every fifteen minutes |
| A stale session cookie made login, signup **and** logout return 403 | the endpoints that repair a broken session were the ones a broken session locked you out of; the only escape was clearing cookies by hand |
| The webhook callback token was only checked when the caller supplied `job` | omitting the parameter skipped verification, leaving an anonymous write path into `webhook_events` with an attacker-chosen dedupe key |
| Retries and dead-letter replays fell into the `mutation` budget | both submit a new billable generation |
| Every zod failure became a 500 with the raw `ZodError` dump as the message | caller mistakes logged as server faults, unreadable in the UI |
| An 8-file upload stored only the last file, with a 200 | a dropped set of character references surfaced later as identity work that had seen one image |
| `RATE_LIMIT_SCALE=0` clamped to 0.01 instead of disabling | "get out of my way" became one request per window, with nothing in the log connecting cause to symptom |
| `Retry-After` was a second too long on an empty bucket | dividing by the rounded refill rate instead of multiplying by the window |

Bucket eviction was also rewritten during this work: the first version evicted
least-recently-used, which let an attacker erase their own penalty by making
noise from a few hundred fresh addresses. It now evicts by fullness, so the
noise evicts itself. That one was caught by a test written before the review.

## Performance defects found after the hardening pass

| Defect | Why it mattered |
|---|---|
| Signed asset URLs embedded `now + ttl`, so every response produced a different string | the review grid re-signs each clip whenever outputs reload — once per approve or reject — so the browser re-downloaded every video and poster in the grid on every decision, and the `cache-control: private, max-age=3600` on the asset route never applied. Both drivers are now anchored to a window boundary (`stableExpiry`), so the URL is byte-identical within the window and still never outlives the requested ttl |

## Bugs this build's own tests found and fixed

Worth recording, because they are the argument for the tests existing:

1. **Out-of-range durations were silently snapped.** The provider contract battery
   caught `validate()` accepting a 999-second request and coercing it to 10s.
   Snapping now only chooses between legal values.
2. **Freezes running to end-of-file were scored as zero frozen seconds.** ffmpeg
   emits `freeze_start` with no `freeze_end` in exactly the worst case — a still
   image padded to length. It now closes the interval at the clip duration.
3. **A batch could collectively blow a per-shot cap.** Every candidate was
   authorized against the same starting balance. Authorization now carries the
   batch's running commitment.
4. **Vertical video was silently low-resolution.** `frameSize` treated the
   resolution label as the height, making "1080p" vertical 608×1080 instead of
   1080×1920.
5. **Form labels were not associated with their controls.** Found by Playwright,
   fixed by rendering controls inside their `<label>` — an accessibility fix, not
   a test workaround.

## Exact commands to run it

```bash
cd masterclip-os
pnpm install
pnpm seed                    # demo project + credentials, printed to stdout
pnpm dev                     # web :4311 · api :4310 · worker
pnpm masterclip doctor       # verify ffmpeg, db, queue, storage, providers, spend
pnpm test && pnpm test:e2e && pnpm typecheck && pnpm lint && pnpm build
```

Requires Node ≥22.5 and ffmpeg/ffprobe on `PATH`.

## Credentials still needed

| For | Variable |
|---|---|
| MuAPI | `MUAPI_API_KEY` (a sandbox/test key first) |
| Google Veo | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` |
| fal | `FAL_KEY` |
| Runway / Luma / Replicate | `RUNWAY_API_KEY` / `LUMA_API_KEY` / `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` |
| Visual QC + producer agents | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| Provider callbacks | `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` + `WEBHOOK_SECRET` |
| Production deployment | `ASSET_SIGNING_SECRET`, `SESSION_SECRET` |

## Security warnings

1. Rate limiting is per process. One API instance is bounded; behind N instances
   the effective budget is N times the configured one, so a cluster still wants a
   shared limiter in the proxy.
2. `TRUST_PROXY` now defaults to off. A deployment that genuinely sits behind a
   proxy **must** set it, or every client will be rate-limited as one address.
3. The S3 driver has never touched a live bucket.
4. `ASSET_SIGNING_SECRET` **must** be set in production — the code refuses to
   start with the development fallback when `NODE_ENV=production`, but check it.

## Cost-saving recommendations

1. **Resolve the Google "per 1 count" unit against a real invoice before routing
   volume there.** It is an 8× ambiguity and it is risk #1.
2. Draft on Wan 2.2 turbo / LTX-2.3 Fast (≈$0.04–0.08/s), finish on Veo 3.1 Fast
   or Lite. Let the router's measured acceptance rates take over from the priors
   after ~20 reviewed candidates per model.
3. Keep visual QC triage on Haiku 4.5 and escalate only uncertain or HERO clips —
   roughly an order of magnitude per frame.
4. Set `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` + `WEBHOOK_SECRET` in any real deployment so providers
   call back instead of being polled.
5. Do not self-host until the measured cost per **accepted** second beats the API.

## Recommended next milestone

**Prove one live provider end to end.** MuAPI, fal and Runway remain
unreachable from this environment; Google and Anthropic became reachable after
the build, so Google is the one to do first. With `GOOGLE_API_KEY` set:

```
pnpm masterclip providers contract --provider google          # free: catalog, capabilities, quote, health
MASTERCLIP_MODE=live LIVE_SPEND_CAP_USD=2 \
  pnpm masterclip providers contract --provider google --submit --project <projectId> --yes
```

The first command spends nothing. The second refuses unless the mode is `live`,
a real project is named, `--yes` is given, **and** the cost controller
authorizes it — it prints the exact figure and declines until you confirm.
Then confirm the charge the ledger records matches Google's own reported cost. That single
run converts six adapters from DEV-LABELED toward REAL faster than any amount of
further building, and it is the only way to close risk #3.

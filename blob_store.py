"""Where uploaded files live.

Everything the app stores - vault audio, cover art, EPK photos, sync
packs, documents - has been landing on the Render disk next to the
SQLite database. That disk is 1 GB and shared with the database, so
audio is the line item that ends the arrangement: a handful of masters
fills it and takes the database down with it.

This puts an object store in front of that disk. Cloudflare R2 because
egress is free, which matters more than the storage price here - a fan
EPK player streams the same file repeatedly, and on S3 the bandwidth
bill outgrows the storage bill quickly.

DESIGN NOTES, in the order they will matter to whoever reads this next:

  Not configured means local disk, not broken. Set the four R2 env vars
  and new uploads go to the bucket; leave them unset and everything
  behaves exactly as it did. No feature disappears, nothing pretends.

  Old rows keep working. Paths already in the database look like
  "/uploads/vault_3_17...mp3" and still resolve to the disk. New objects
  are stored as "r2:<key>". Two shapes, one resolver, no migration
  required to deploy. A backfill can move the old ones later.

  Signed by hand rather than with boto3. SigV4 is hmac + hashlib, and
  boto3 would add ~50 MB to a Starter build for two API calls.

  Reads are presigned and short-lived. The bucket stays private, so a
  vault URL cannot be forwarded to somebody who should not have it -
  it expires. That is the whole reason not to make the bucket public.

Credentials come from the environment and are never logged:
  R2_ACCOUNT_ID, R2_BUCKET, R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID, R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
Optional: R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL, if you attach a custom domain and want
plain public URLs for non-sensitive assets instead of signed ones.

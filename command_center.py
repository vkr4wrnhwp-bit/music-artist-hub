"""Street Banker Command Center + global Actions.

The operating-system spine: unified scores computed live from the real
modules (Links, Rollout Studio, Fan CRM, Catalog, EPK), derived health
alerts that always point at a destination, a persistent action/task
system, and the registry of every OS module with an honest Live/Preview
status. Scores are derived fresh on every load rather than snapshotted —
no stale numbers, no fake data.

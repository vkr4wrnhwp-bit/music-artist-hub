"""Remix Lab, connected to the audio seam.

The page shipped saying generation was not connected, and it was right to: a
brief that opens "original sits around 92 BPM in A minor" needs somebody to
have listened to the record, and inventing that number is the most damaging
fake available here because a producer would act on it.

A MusicProvider now exposes composition_plan() — tempo, section boundaries,
an energy curve — which is a measurement. These tests are about the line
between what is measured, what is convention, and what is still nobody's to
claim.

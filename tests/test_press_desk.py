"""Press Desk — one artist's media list, announcements and pitches.

Three things these tests care about more than the rest:

  Nobody sees anybody else's list. A press list is the most portable
  asset an artist has, and the failure mode is silent: a route that
  forgets its WHERE user_id clause returns somebody else's contacts and
  looks perfectly normal doing it.

  A refusal to send is a feature. The shared test sender delivers only to
  the account owner's inbox, so a pitch sent through it reports success
  and reaches no journalist. These tests pin the refusal, because the
  tempting "fix" is to let it through.

  Nothing is invented. There is no seeded contact, no example outlet and
  no sample coverage. An empty desk renders empty.

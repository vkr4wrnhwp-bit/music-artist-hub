"""The stylesheet is built, committed, and therefore able to go stale.

Swapping the Tailwind Play CDN for a built file trades 120 kB of runtime
compiler for 14 kB of static CSS. The cost of that trade is a new failure
mode: add a class to a template, forget to rebuild, and the page renders
without it. Nothing crashes. Nothing logs. It just looks wrong, and only
on the page you were last editing.

So the suite samples the classes actually used across the templates and
fails when the stylesheet does not carry them. Rebuild from the repo root:

    npm install tailwindcss@3
    npx tailwindcss -c tools/tailwind.config.js \\
        -i tools/tailwind-input.css \\
        -o static/css/tailwind.css --minify

Then bump the ?v= on the <link> and VERSION in static/js/sw.js, or
browsers keep serving the old sheet.

# --- utilities that resolve to nothing -----------------------------------
#
# test_the_stylesheet_is_not_stale above only looks at arbitrary-value
# classes, on the reasoning that nothing but Tailwind produces a class with
# brackets in it. That is true, and it is also why the check missed the
# worst stylesheet regression this repo has had.
#
# The design-system-v1 sweep (90754c4) rewrote every raw hex in the markup
# into a token class. Where it could not resolve one it wrote a class that
# does not exist - bg-transparent-bright, border-sb-line-strong-bright,
# text-sb-ink-deep - and in 27 places that class was the fill of a
# proportion bar, so every bar in the royalty, capital and analytics pages
# rendered as an empty outline. The raw-hex lock passed, because the hex
# really was gone. The staleness check passed, because none of the broken
# classes had brackets. Nothing else looked.
#
# So: a class in the markup that looks like a utility must resolve to a
# rule somewhere. Hand-written class names are out of scope - one with no
# rule may be a JavaScript hook rather than a defect, and telling those
# apart is a lint concern, not a question about whether the build is
# current.

"""No Python object ever renders onto a public page.

This exists because it already happened: `BRAND_MEMORY["copy"]` and
`FAN_PANEL["copy"]` were read in a template as `brand.copy`, Jinja
resolved that to the dict's built-in `copy` method rather than the
string, and the public smart-link page shipped
`<built-in method copy of dict object at 0x000001...>` to visitors.

Two tests here. The first walks every public page and fails on any
rendered object string. The second is the cheaper guard: no config dict
may use a key that collides with a dict method, because the template that
reads it will look correct and render garbage.

    `thing.copy` in Jinja resolves to the dict's built-in method before it
    looks for the key, and renders `<built-in method copy of dict object

    always safe, which is why configs may legitimately carry keys called
    copy, items, keys or values.

    This test therefore bans the dangerous *access*, not the name. It
    caught a live one: `clean_release.html` read `n.keys` on a dict that
    really did have a "keys" key, and shipped the built-in method into a
    data-cats attribute, silently breaking the hover-highlight it fed.

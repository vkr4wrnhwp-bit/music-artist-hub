"""Section 7 — Creative Studio.

The photograph carries the section, so the tests care most about what is
NOT in it: nothing generated, nothing invented, no lettering the markup
should have carried. The section now ships a real photograph rather than
a repaired layout mockup, and these tests hold that line. The rest is the
ordinary contract - the copy is markup, the labels say a sentence each,
and a stranger can read what the tools do and do not do without an
account.
